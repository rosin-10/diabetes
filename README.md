Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes in the future, based on certain health metrics. The model is trained using a dataset of patient data, and the prediction is available through a simple web interface built with Gradio.

Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model built using Python that predicts whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on various health indicators, such as blood glucose level, BMI, age, and more.

A Gradio interface is used to provide an easy-to-use web app where users can input their data, and the model will output whether they have a high or low chance of developing diabetes.

This project requires the following libraries:

  gradio for creating the web interface
  kaleido for rendering plots
  pandas for data manipulation
  numpy for numerical operations
  scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
  imbalanced-learn for data augmentation (SMOTE)
  seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization
